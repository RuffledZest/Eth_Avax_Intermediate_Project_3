# Custom ERC20 Token

This Project demostrates the  smart contract to create our own ERC20 token and deploy it using HardHat localnetwork.


# Description

* This project includes all the functionalities of ERC20 token (the contract implements ERC20)
* Along with the basic functionality it also follows the following criteria:
    * Only contract owner should be able to mint tokens
    * Any user can transfer tokens
